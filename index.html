				R workshop at the 2014 RPM
			</h1>

			<p>This page will host instructions, data and source code for the R workshop at the 2014 RPM seminar. <a href=http://www.casact.org/rpm/index.cfm?fa=registration></a>To register, please visit the CAS
			website.</p>

			<h2><a name="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Overview</a></h2>

			<p>What will you do in this workshop? What won’t you do? You’ll hear all about how tremendous R is, where it came from, where it’s going and 
			how it has become the tool of choice for tens of thousands of analysts across the world. You’ll learn how to make sure it runs smoothly despite 
			the objections of your company’s IT department. You’ll learn how to exploit the knowledge of other R users. You’ll learn how to import and export 
			information from text files, Excel files, databases and the web. You’ll draw pictures of the probability density function for loss development factors. 
			You’ll use monte carlo simulation. You’ll learn how to use generalized linear modeling to predict the results of football games. You’ll create a 
			color-coded map to show which states produce poor underwriting results. What else? If time permits, you might use cluster analysis. Or, you might 
			build a word cloud to mine text information from your claims data.
			</p>
			
			<h2><a name="whatisR" class="anchor" href="#whatisR"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>What is R?</a></h2>
			<p>R is a programming language, derived from S. It is an "open source" project, which means that its license entitles anyone to use the software, so long as they 
			keep their use of the software "open". The specific licensing language may be found here: <a href=http://www.r-project.org/COPYING>http://www.r-project.org/COPYING</a>.
			The practical consequence of an open source project is that- similar to something like Wikipedia- users may contribute improvements and extensions to the project. </p>
			
			<p>Information about R may be found at <a href=http://www.r-project.org/>http://www.r-project.org/</a>. Another great source for inspiration is 
			<a href=http://www.r-bloggers.com/>http://www.r-bloggers.com/</a>. Here, you'll see examples where R has been applied in dozens of different contexts. This is an 
			aggregation of blogs from around the world and changes every day. It's always worth checking out. There are at least two R-focused blogs written by actuaries.
			The first is <a href=http://lamages.blogspot.com/>http://lamages.blogspot.com/</a> written by Markus Gesman in London. Markus works for Lloyds and is the 
			original author of the ChainLadder package in R. Another, <a href=http://pirategrunt.com/>http://pirategrunt.com/</a>, is written by me. This is where I write about
			stuff that interests me in a format where I needn't worry quite so much about how polished the verbiage and analysis is. I'll give the standard caveat that the 
			views expressed on my blog do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer, the CAS or anyone other than me.

			<p>Participants will get the most out of the session if they show up with a laptop which has R and R Studio already installed. This will enable folks to follow along with the examples and ask for help in real time. The first place to look for installation is <a href=http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html>http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html</a>

			<h2><a name="installingRStudio" class="anchor" href="#installingRStudio"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Installing R Studio</a></h2>
			<p>Installing R is most of the battle. Depending on the sort of person you are, it may even be all of the battle. R comes with a fairly spartan user interface, which is sufficient </p>
			
			<p>It all sounds so easy, but in practice this is rarely the case. One of the difficulties lies in navigating the infrastructure developed by your company's IT department. I've written some suggestions on <a href=http://pirategrunt.github.io/RPM2014/IT.html>how to deal with your IT department</a>, which I hope are useful.</p>

## Introducing vectors

In R, every variable is a vector. Think of a set of cells in a spreadsheet. 

Here, e is a vector with N values. X1 is the sequence of integers from 1 through 10 repeated 10 times. 

Vectors can grow and shrink automatically. No need to move cells around on a sheet. No need to copy formulas or change named ranges.

```{r eval=TRUE}
source("../inst/scripts/BasicScript.R")
e  <- rnorm(N, mean = 0, sd = 1)
X1 <- rep(seq(1,10), 10)
Y  <- B0 + B1 * X1 + e
```

## Vector properties

* Vectors have one dimension
* Higher dimensions are possible via matrices and arrays
* Every element in a vector must be the same type
* Different types are possible by using a list or a data frame
* Possible to add metadata via attributes

## Vector construction

Vectors are constructed in one of several ways:

* Return from a function or operation
    * `seq`, `rep`, `sample`
* Concatenation
* Growth by assignment

## `seq`

`seq` is used often to generate a sequence of values. The colon operator `:` is a shortcut for a sequence of integers.

```{r }
pies = seq(from = 0, by = pi, length.out = 5)
i <- 1:5
year = 2000:2004
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(rblocks)
i <- 1:5
block = make_block(i, type = 'vector')
block
```

## `rep`

The `rep` function will replicate its input 
```{r }
i = rep(pi, 100)
head(i)
```

## Concatenation

```{r results='hide'}
i <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
j <- c(6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
k <- c(i, j)
l <- c(1:5, 6:10)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
i = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
j = c(6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
k = c(i, j)
block_i = make_block(i, type = 'vector')
block_j = make_block(j, type = 'vector')
block_i[1:5] = "red"
block_j[1:5] = "blue"
block_k = make_block(c(block_i,block_j), type='vector')
block_k[1:5] = "red"
block_k[6:10] <- "blue"

block_i
block_j
block_k
```

## Growth by assignment
```{r }
i <- 1:10
i[30] = pi
i
```

## Vector access - by index

Vectors may be accessed by their numeric indices. Remember, ':' is shorthand to generate a sequence.

```{r }
e[1]
e[1:4]
e[c(1,3)]
```

## Vector access - logical access

Vectors may be accessed logically. This may be done by passing in a logical vector, or a logical expression.

```{r }
i = 5:9
i[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)]
i[i > 7]
b = i > 7
i[b]
```

## `which`

The `which` function returns indices that match a logical expression.

```{r }
i <- 10:20
which(i > 12)
i[which(i > 12)]
```

## `sample`

The `sample` function will generate a random sample. Great to use for randomizing a vector.

```{r }
months <- c("January", "February", "March", "April"
            , "May", "June", "July", "August"
            , "September", "October", "November", "December")

set.seed(1234)
mixedMonths <- sample(months)
head(mixedMonths)
```

Get lots of months with the `size` parameter:
```{r }
set.seed(1234)
lotsOfMonths <- sample(months, size = 100, replace = TRUE)
head(lotsOfMonths)
```

## `sample` II

Sample may also be used within the indexing of the vector itself:

```{r }
set.seed(1234)
moreMonths <- months[sample(1:12, replace=TRUE, size=100)]
head(moreMonths)

# Cleaner with sample.int
set.seed(1234)
evenMoreMonths <- months[sample.int(length(months), size=100, replace=TRUE)]
head(evenMoreMonths)
```

## `order`

The function `order` will return the indices of the vector in order.

```{r }
set.seed(1234)
x <- c(sample(90:100))
x
order(x)
x[order(x)]
```


## Vector arithmetic

Vectors may be used in arithmetic operations. Y is now a vector with length equal to the longest vector used in the calculation.
  
```{r eval=FALSE}
Y = B0 + B1 * X1 + e
```
  
Question: B0 and B1 are vectors of length 1. X1 and e are vectors of length 100. How are they combined?


## Recycling

R will "recycle" vectors until there are enough elements to perform an operation. Everything gets as "long" as the longest vector in the operation. For scalar operations on a vector this doesn't involve any drama. Try the following code:

```{r size='tiny'}
vector1 = 1:10
vector2 = 1:5
scalar = 3

print(vector1 + scalar)
print(vector2 + scalar)
print(vector1 + vector2)
```

## Summarization - Part I

```{r eval=FALSE}
x = 1:50
sum(x)
mean(x)
max(x)
length(x)
```

## Set theory - Part I

The `%in%` operator will return a logical vector indicating whether or not an element of the first set is contained in the second set.

```{r }
x <- 1:10
y <- 5:15
x %in% y
```

## Set theory - Part II

```{r }
?union
x <- 1900:1910
y <- 1905:1915
intersect(x, y)
setdiff(x, y)
setequal(x, y)
```

## Vectors 

If you understand vectors- how to create them, how to manipulate them, how to access the elements, you're well on your way to grasping how to handle other objects in R. 

Fundamentally, _everything_ in R is a vector sooner or later.

## Exercise - Vectors

Create a vector of length 10, with years starting from 1980.

Create a vector with values from 1972 to 2012 in increments of four (1972, 1976, 1980, etc.)

Construct the following vectors:
```{r }
FirstName <- c("Richard", "James", "Ronald", "Ronald"
              , "George", "William", "William", "George"
              , "George", "Barack", "Barack")
LastName <- c("Nixon", "Carter", "Reagan", "Reagan"
              , "Bush", "Clinton", "Clinton", "Bush"
              , "Bush", "Obama", "Obama")
ElectionYear <- seq(1972, 2012, 4)
```

* List the last names in alphabetical order
* List the years in order by first name.
* Create a vector of years when someone named "George" was elected.
* How many Georges were elected before 1996?
* Generate a random sample of 100 presidents.

## Answer
```{r }
LastName[order(LastName)]
ElectionYear[order(FirstName)]
ElectionYear[FirstName == 'George']
myLogical <- (FirstName == 'George') & (ElectionYear < 1996)
length(which(myLogical))
sum(myLogical)
```

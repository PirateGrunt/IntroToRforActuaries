ALR Prep Notes
This is not necessarily what I am going to share . . . just studying up


Different types of regression
linear
polynomial
piecewise
robust
multiple
non-linear
non-parametric

Linear regression follows the form y = a + bx

Maximum likelihood estimation: "given the data. and having selected a linear model, we want to find the values of the slope and intercept that make the data most likely" (Crawley 389).

residual: d = y less y hat

Important assumptions in linear modeling
variance of y is constant
x is measured correctly
residuals are normally distributed

TODO Prove that "the sum of the residuals will always be zero"
TODO Prove that the best fit line always passes through x bar, y bar

degrees of freedom is assigned as n - k where n is number of observations and k is number of estimated parameters

## What's with your hair?

As I write these words, I have a full head of hair and even a beard. By the time the wheels touch down in Texas, all that will be gone. Why? Because I'm participating in a fundraising event for [The St. Baldrick's Foundation](http://www.stbaldricks.org/). St. Baldricks has been raising money for pediatric cancer research for fifteen years. With roots (no pun intended) in the [reinsurance industry](http://www.stbaldricks.org/history), it has grown to become one of the largest providers of clinical research dollars in the world. Along with my friend and colleague Doug Page, I'm proud to serve as a co-organizer of this year's event being held in Raleigh. Last year, we raised just under $350,000 to support children and families suffering from cancer- one of the top ten events in the world.

## What's social hacking?

The CAS wants the RPM and other seminars to be events where actuaries can come together to talk, to learn, to network and have fun. Space will be arranged for anyone at the RPM to bring their curiosity, their skills, their questions, their data and their laptop and hack. After you've learned R, take this opportunity to see it in action in a less structured, less formal environment. Details will be provided as they emerge.
